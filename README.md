Coding Kata Starting Points
===========================

These are starting points for coding katas.

These are based on the starting point files for Cyber-Dojo files.  I have
modified them to work with the default setup on a Macbook Pro with default
settings.

To use the c-test framework you will need to install check and pkg-config
from brew or macports.  This setup uses GNU Make, and tries to explain
how the setup works.

To use the cpp-gtest framework you will need to install cmake.  The version
from brew or macports will be happier than what you might install from the
cmake download.  I also try to explain what is going on here.
